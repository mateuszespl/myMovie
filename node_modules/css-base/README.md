## css-base **(WIP)**

Am opinionated set of CSS styles that serve as default styles, developed as a cross-browser compatibility rule set

Designed to be used with [rework-npm](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework-npm)

```
@import 'css-base'

/* or include just specific files */

@import 'css-base/base.css'
```

- redefined tags to use as non standard markup:
  + `<i>` block-inline elements - replacement for `<span>`
  + `<b>` block elements - replacement for `<div>`

### grid.css
- 12 elastic columns - *n* columns per row
- 2 to 6 grid blocks
